#### Madison Mina & Dimas Monte

We will be analyzing the "Mobiles Dataset (2025)" by Abdul Malik on Kaggle. This dataset has 15 columns and 930 rows, it includes mobile phone specifications such as Company, Model, RAM, Cameras, Battery, and Prices across various countries (Pakistan, India, China, the United States, and the UAE). 

Our first focus will be on the launch prices and how they correlate with the country of release. Our second focus will be on the specific features of each phone and how it relates to the resulted price. Our final task is to predict the price of future phones of these features in their respective countries.
